- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AritaZ-hang
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in single-cell multimodal/multiomics integration & new tools/algorithms development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning in Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST), PRC. In Sept., I'll go to Zhejiang University for postgraduate education.
